## UI Kata

This is part of my UI Kata learning initiative. I find sketch files of UI's on the internet and code them up focusing on 5 things:
 - React component structure
 - High quality CSS
 - Responsiveness (mobile first)
 - Component testing

## Design

## Responsive and tested!

Have a look at the code and let me know what you think. Thanks.
