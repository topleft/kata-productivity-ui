## UI Kata

This is part of my UI Kata learning initiative. I find sketch files of UI's on the internet and code them up. With this project I focused on:

 - React component structure
 - High quality CSS
 - Component testing ... TODO ;)

## Design

Thanks to **Adrian Madacs** for the excellent design and sketch files.
